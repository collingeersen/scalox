# Scalox

Implementing a lox interpreter in Scala for the second part of the book "Crafting Interpreters" with some additional features and capabilities.
***
### Rational
This project is for me to further my understanding of language implementation, which is a passion of mine. This project reinforces my understanding of design patterns, algorithms, and a deeper understanding of programming languages.

### Why Scala?
I picked Scala since wanted to learn an additional language that targets the JVM, especially one that has greater functional features. Scala is also uniquely useful for creating an interpreter because of its feature rich support for pattern matching.
